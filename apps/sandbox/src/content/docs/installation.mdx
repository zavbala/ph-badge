import NPM from "../../components/npm";
import Callout from "../../components/callout";

Pick your favorite framework / library and install the package.

<NPM show client:load />

For vue, the package `@ph-badge/vue` has the right deps to use either with Vue 2 or Vue 3.

<Callout type='danger'>
  Currently only is available for react, all the packages working but I wanna test it and find a way
  to create types for each one.
</Callout>
